## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

A local photographer, approached me to create a portfolio to that would help attract potential clients and showcase her previous work. The primary goal of this project was to establish a tailored online presence for her to share with potential clients, ultimately boosting her client base.

## Optimizations

This project was initially developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, as my expertise on React grew, I realize it would be beneficial to eventually make the transition to a more modern framework, like React.js or Next.js, as there are multiple repeated elements across the pages.

## Lessons Learned:

I explored different methods for achieving an image transition effect on the Home page, utilizing keyframes to rotate between images. Also found an effective method to add a stroke effect around text using the CSS text-shadow property. Additionally, I incorporated Lightbox for the first time, allowing clients to click on photos for a closer view.
